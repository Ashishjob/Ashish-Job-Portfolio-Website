## Welcome to the Background Behind My Website!! ðŸ¥³

Welcome to my portfolio website! This was my first experience with a lot of the technologies I used, but it really taught me fundamentals on how to go from [my first portfolio website](https://ashishjob.web.app/) to [this one](https://ashishjob.com/). Along the way, I kept surfing through plenty pf websites, to find some ideas that caught my interest and that I wanted to implement in my own, and I realized that I wanted to keep it as simple as I could.

## Experiences With the Used Technologies ðŸ“‹

### Next.js: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800523149241352233/1119866415692918844/rZL5N8AJA23K4ax1AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC.png" align="left" alt="Java" width="30px">

I've used React.js before, but Next.js still took me some time to understand, but luckily their extensive documentation helped a lot, and I ended up gaining a comprehensive understanding of the framework's key concepts.

### TailwindCSS: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800523149241352233/1119865951131807866/2048px-Tailwind_CSS_Logo.png" align="left" alt="Java" width="30px">

This was my first time doing an entire project on my own with TailwindCSS, but I found out how much I really loved it because of how efficient it made developing a website, and how amazing it was to help the screen resposiveness as I had to scrap my entire original project due to unresponsiveness.

### TypeScript: <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/800523149241352233/1119866143394517053/2048px-Typescript_logo_2020.png" align="left" alt="Java" width="30px">

Finally, we have TypeScript, and this one was a hard one to figure out for me personally, since I also didn't have the most experience with JavaScript, but just like the other technologies, documentation really came in handy.
